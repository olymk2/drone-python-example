#+TITLE: drone python example plugin


Very basic plugin, just lists out the environment variables available.

From here you can code what ever you want, the project is mounted to this container.

* Building locally

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker build -t olymk2/drone-python-example .
#+END_SRC

* Testing locally
You can run the plugin from docker with the command below, or just run =python example.py= outside the container.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
docker run drone-python-example
#+END_SRC
